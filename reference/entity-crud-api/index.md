# Entity CRUD API

This section describes the functionality of the CRUD API generated by both of
the following mechanisms:

1. Exporting an endpoint with the `crud()` function on a `ChiselEntity` class.
1. Use of the [ChiselNow] quickstart tool.

In either case, it's assumed here that you know the endpoint URL that was
generated for you, and are able to use that to construct HTTP requests as
described.

:::note

**For ChiselNow projects**, when invoking methods that can mutate data (all
non-GET requests) you must add your API key in the `X-Token` request header,
like this:

```bash
curl \
    -X DELETE \
    -H "X-Token: [YOUR-TOKEN]"
    "https://host/dev/entity/[GENERATED-ID]"
```
